*******************

It looks like you have a well-structured validation system, but the issue seems to be in the interaction between the postal code validation and the form rendering of the error message. Specifically, there are a few things that could be causing the error messages for postal codes to not show up, even though the console logs are working fine.

Potential Issue
Incorrect Error Message Display Logic:
You are using inputEl.setCustomValidity(message || "") in the displayError method to show the error message. This is a valid method, but it might be affecting the form's native validation behavior. The custom validity only works if the form is being submitted, and not necessarily during input.

The Error Element Not Being Updated:
You are attempting to show error messages by manipulating the DOM element with id="postal-error", but the error element might not be getting updated as expected. You could ensure that the correct element is targeted and is visible when a validation fails.

Potential Issue with RegEx Matching:
You are using a regular expression for the postal code validation. If countryValue doesn't match a key in this.postalConstraints, then the regex will not be applied properly.

Suggested Fixes
1. Ensure the postal-error Element Exists
First, make sure that the error message is being correctly rendered to the element with id="postal-error". In your DOMHandler, you have a reference to the error elements like this:

js
Copy
Edit
this.postalError = document.querySelector('#postal-error');
Ensure that your HTML has the corresponding <span> or <div> elements for error messages, for example:

html
Copy
Edit
<span id="postal-error" class="error-message"></span>
2. Handle the Postal Validation Properly
In your postalValidation function, ensure that the error message is properly set using this.displayError(postalElement, error), which should be updating the inner text of the error element.

To improve clarity, check the following:

Check if the country code exists in this.postalConstraints

Refactor the regex matching to avoid errors when no country is selected.

js
Copy
Edit
postalValidation (countryValue, postalElement) {
    let error = null;

    if (postalElement.validity.valueMissing) {
        error = "Please enter your postal code";
        console.log('Postal code is missing');
    } else {
        // Ensure that the country exists in the postal constraints
        const postalConstraint = this.postalConstraints[countryValue];
        if (postalConstraint) {
            const constraint = new RegExp(postalConstraint[0]);

            if (!constraint.test(postalElement.value.trim())) {
                error = postalConstraint[1];
            }
        } else {
            error = "Invalid country code for postal validation";
        }
    }

    this.displayError(postalElement, error);
    return error;
}
3. Debugging the displayError Method
You are using setCustomValidity which may be preventing the visual error message from showing up dynamically during input. This is generally used to trigger a form validation error when submitting the form, but for live input validation, manipulating the DOM directly to display the error message might be better.

You can refactor the displayError method to update the error message in the DOM without setCustomValidity, as shown below:

js
Copy
Edit
displayError (inputEl, message) {
    // Update the error message directly
    const errorID = `${inputEl.id}-error`;
    const errorElement = document.getElementById(errorID);

    if (errorElement) {
        errorElement.textContent = message || "";
        errorElement.style.display = message ? 'block' : 'none'; // Show/hide error message
    }
}
In the above, we're ensuring the error message element is visible when an error exists, and hidden when there's no error.

4. Ensure the Event Listener for Postal Validation is Correct
You are listening for the input event, which is good, but make sure that the event listener is correctly firing by logging it:

js
Copy
Edit
checkPostalValidation = () => {
    const postal = this.elements.postalInput;
    const country = this.elements.countryInput;

    postal.addEventListener('input', () => {
        const countryValue = country.value;
        console.log(`Validating postal code: ${postal.value} for country: ${countryValue}`); // Debugging
        this.validator.postalValidation(countryValue, postal);
    });
}
Final Check
After making the above changes, your postal validation should now show the correct error message in the appropriate DOM element. You can inspect the browser console to see if the event listener is firing as expected and that the error messages are being updated in the DOM.
